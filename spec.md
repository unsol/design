ewasm specification
===================

Introduction
------------

This document aims to specify an ewasm VM in a way useful to contract writers and VM implementers.
To this end, multiple things are specified:

-   The extra state that a VM needs to have around to successfully respond to calls into the EEI.
-   The EEI (Ethereum Environment Interface), currently specified loosley [here](eth_interface.md).
